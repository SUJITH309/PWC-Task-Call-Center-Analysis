# PWC Task-Call Center Analysis
Leveraged Power BI to analyze HR data, focusing on gender-related KPIs. Identified root causes for gender imbalance at the executive management level. Created informative dashboards to communicate key performance indicators effectively.


For this project, I analyzed customer service performance using key KPIs like overall customer satisfaction, call abandonment rates, and agent efficiency metrics (e.g., average handle time vs. calls answered). By visualizing trends and agent performance, I provided actionable insights to enhance service quality and optimize staffing strategies.
